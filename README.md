### Overview
This is a challenge which is created by me for Myself to prepare for<b> Placements </b> within this year(i.e 2020 but it's not recommended that you must start this challenge from now only and finish it before 2020, you can start from any day but then you have to learn it/practice it for consecutive 100 days. <b>But please start, before it's too late.</b> <br>
But during the planning of this Curriculum, I thought about why to learn alone When I can learn together with other people! especially my batchmates of <b>IMSEC</b> And that's When this idea of making this as a challenge arose in my mind so other people who are thinking of preparing for placements since a long time but due to any reason they could not start it, can start now. And I make this as a challenge so we take it seriously and give our precious time to learn daily for consecutive 100 days in a row. And also, The whole curriculum and all the links given below are Completely free. <br>
Campus placements season is going to begin at almost all the colleges and each one of us wants to prepare to do the best. <br>
<b><em>I have planned this to prepare for Computer Science and IT sector placements.
