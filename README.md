# Prepare for Placements in only 100 days.

### Course Objective

This is a challenge which is created by me for Myself to prepare for Placements within this year(i.e 2020 but its not recommended that you must start this challenge from now only and finish it before 2020,you can start from anyday but then you have to learn it/practice it for consecutive 100 days. <br> <br> <b>Remember, 100days streak is our Goal.</b> <br> <br>
But during the planning of this Curriculum I thought why to learn alone When I can learn together with other people! specially my batchmates of <b>IMSEC</b> And that's When this idea of making this as a challenge arose in my mind so other people who are thinking of preparation for placements since a long time but due to anyreason they could not start it ,can start now. And I Make this as challenge so we take it seriously and give our precious time to learn daily for consecutive 100 days in a row. And also ,The whole curriculum and all the links given below is Completely free. <br>
Campus placements season is going to begin at almost all the colleges and each one of us wants to prepare to do the best.
<b><em>I have planned this to prepare for Computer Science and IT sectors placements.</em></b> <br>

<b>So if you accept this Challenge then you must have to do these 2 things: <br> <br>
1.Make a Pledge to learn or practice everyday for the next 100 days. <br> 2.Join this telegram channel initiated by me.</b>
