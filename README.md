![](images/1.jpg)
## Overview
This is a challenge which is created by me for Myself to prepare for Placements within this year(i.e 2020 but it's not recommended that you must start this challenge from now only and finish it before 2020, you can start from any day but then you have to learn it/practice it for consecutive 100 days. <b>But start it before it's too late.</b> <br> <br> <b>Remember, 100days streak is our Goal.</b> <br> <br>
But during the planning of this Curriculum, I thought about why to learn alone When I can learn together with other people! especially my batchmates of <b>IMSEC</b> And that's When this idea of making this as a challenge arose in my mind so other people who are thinking of preparing for placements since a long time but due to any reason they could not start it, can start now.
